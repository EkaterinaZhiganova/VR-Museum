The unity package was too big so I had to split it as a Zip archive. 
Project created by Fredrik Persson, Joacim Bengtsson and Ekaterina Zhiganova.
The project was created as the final task of the "Optimization" course in Unity. It focuses on baked light, LODs, teleportation, low poly models, texture atlas.
The project is a museum room with paintings on the walls. The player can move within the teleportation areas. 
The paintings, their frames (including textures and LODs) were created by me in Maya and Substance Painter.
Baked spotlight for every painting was also created by me.
